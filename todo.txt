add a whole number type for computed breaks (rather than just currency)

mimic button setup / ui from previous map
read attributes from json rather than hardcode to menu
import all acs attributes from old acs map




interesting ideas
------------
api data returned as hash map where key is geonum - much faster
mouseover on legend to highlight those values on map
cache data from ajax calls


supplemental service
------------
update tile server to eliminate 404s
webshot service
precompute all breaks into own json file (add as npm task)


roadmap
----------
additional vector tile layers for differing census geographies
additional vintages of acs
add census 2010
last - adapt to own census api


build todos
--------------
rollup cache busting 
rollup uglify
