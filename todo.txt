port to create-react-app?

new datasets
colorscheme picker / classification picker


SERVER
------
tileset attribution: on original
slightly less blocky on resolution
storing all objects in memory in redux is causing lag?

go static




roadmap
----------
add search
mouseover for value on map
chart
table
right-click individual table
webshot service
 - query parameter as minified redux string
 - if valid, parse it and load it.
 
 

notes
--------
change in dataset -> change geography -> change theme -> change symbology -> updateMap
