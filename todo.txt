break out logic for loading sources and layers

implement previous ACS years

geography tab different based on selected dataset

continous loop that compares rendered geonums to previous rendered geonums and redraws map if different
 -- only redraws changed geonums

  query store for data
  then query db for remaining data
  combine data
    or, for performance, render from localstorage and remote async
  



SERVER
------
api post request instead of get
update tile server to eliminate 404s




colorscheme picker / classification picker
delay - on purpose: default unrendered tiles as transparent or white


geography picker
 expanded geographies
 pick a geo hierarchy 
 - county - tract - bg
 - state - county - countysubdivision
 ---------------------------------------
 - msa - cbsa - place
 - state - zcta
 - state - puma




roadmap
----------
add search
additional vector tile layers for differing census geographies
additional vintages of acs
add census 2010
mouseover for value on map
last - adapt to own census api
webshot service
 
 
 
interesting ideas
------------
streaming OBOE.js - any advantage over gzip?
PREACT?
api data returned as hash map where key is geonum - much faster
mouseover on legend to highlight those values on map
cache data from ajax calls


build todos
--------------
rollup cache busting 
rollup uglify
