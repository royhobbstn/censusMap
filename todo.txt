interesting ideas
------------
streaming OBOE.js - any advantage over gzip?
PREACT?
REDUX
api data returned as hash map where key is geonum - much faster
mouseover on legend to highlight those values on map
cache data from ajax calls


supplemental service
------------
update tile server to eliminate 404s
webshot service


roadmap
----------
add search
additional vector tile layers for differing census geographies
