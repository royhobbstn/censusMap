add title to legend
read attributes from json rather than hardcode to menu

color breaks json
import all acs attributes from old acs map

table-ify legend (line up < + symbols)


interesting ideas
------------
api data returned as hash map where key is geonum - much faster
mouseover on legend to highlight those values on map
cache data from ajax calls


supplemental service
------------
update tile server to eliminate 404s
webshot service
precompute all breaks into own json file (add as npm task)


roadmap
----------
add search
additional vector tile layers for differing census geographies
additional vintages of acs
add census 2010
last - adapt to own census api


build todos
--------------
rollup cache busting 
rollup uglify
