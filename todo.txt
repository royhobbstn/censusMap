 expanded geographies
 pick a geo hierarchy 
 - county - tract - bg
 - state - county - countysubdivision

roadmap
----------
add search
additional vector tile layers for differing census geographies
additional vintages of acs
add census 2010
mouseover for value on map
last - adapt to own census api
webshot service
 
 
 
interesting ideas
------------
streaming OBOE.js - any advantage over gzip?
PREACT?
api data returned as hash map where key is geonum - much faster
mouseover on legend to highlight those values on map
cache data from ajax calls


build todos
--------------
rollup cache busting 
rollup uglify
