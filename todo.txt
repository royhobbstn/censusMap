small legend tweaks

interesting ideas
------------
streaming OBOE.js - any advantage over gzip?
PREACT?
REDUX
api data returned as hash map where key is geonum - much faster
mouseover on legend to highlight those values on map
cache data from ajax calls


supplemental service
------------
update tile server to eliminate 404s
webshot service


roadmap
----------
add search
additional vector tile layers for differing census geographies
additional vintages of acs
add census 2010
last - adapt to own census api

Computed Breaks
 - batch promises on compute-breaks, and use larger sample sizes
 - add 'sample' to computed breaks
 - will probably want to break into individual files for dataset / theme
   (to prevent loading all breaks info upfront)
 
build todos
--------------
rollup cache busting 
rollup uglify
