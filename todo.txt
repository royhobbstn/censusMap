toggle timer function when zoom or mouse move.  turns off when map is loaded.

only load from localstorage once
in memory stops for quick paints, so not rebuilding from scratch



save stops persistent in localstorage
load stops from localstorage on theme change

painting map should not be connected to redux events or ui updates
but rather indirectly.  actions will trigger not-idle state
main loop (paint checking) continuously runs, but only acts if in un-idle state

should we query out stops only for visible elements? (for speed)?



keep track of idle:  session storage.
call to reset idle time to 500ms
 - when:
    ajax returned
    new stops calculated
    query features
    (examples)


lots of stats

colorscheme picker / classification picker




SERVER
------
adapt to own census api
api post request instead of get


roadmap
----------
add search
mouseover for value on map
chart
table
right-click individual table
webshot service
 - query parameter as minified redux string
 - if valid, parse it and load it.
 
 
interesting ideas
------------
PREACT?
Deck GL?
mouseover on legend to highlight those values on map
get rid of font awesome in favor of bootstrap glyphicons?





notes
--------
change in dataset -> change geography -> change theme -> change symbology -> updateMap


geography picker
 expanded geographies
 pick a geo hierarchy
 - county - tract - bg
 - state - county - countysubdivision
 ---------------------------------------
 - msa - cbsa - place
 - state - zcta
 - state - puma
