throttle promises on compute breaks

implement previous ACS years using load sources and layers

lots of stats

colorscheme picker / classification picker




SERVER
------
api post request instead of get
compute breaks is fragile - maybe a breaks api && save to localstorage



roadmap
----------
add search
mouseover for value on map
chart
table
right-click individual table
last - adapt to own census api
webshot service
 - query parameter as minified redux string
 - if valid, parse it and load it.
 
 
interesting ideas
------------
PREACT?
Deck GL?
mouseover on legend to highlight those values on map
get rid of font awesome in favor of bootstrap glyphicons?





notes
--------
change in dataset -> change geography -> change theme -> change symbology -> updateMap


geography picker
 expanded geographies
 pick a geo hierarchy
 - county - tract - bg
 - state - county - countysubdivision
 ---------------------------------------
 - msa - cbsa - place
 - state - zcta
 - state - puma
